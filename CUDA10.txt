1) Add PPA:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers
sudo apt-get update

2) Install drivers (need >=410):

sudo apt-get install nvidia-410

3) The CUDA runfile installer can be downloaded from NVIDIAâ€™s website. Choose the runfile option:

https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

What you download is a package the following three components:

a)an NVIDIA driver installer, but usually of stale version;
b)the actual CUDA installer;
c)the CUDA samples installer;

4) extract the above three components and executing 2 and 3 separately (remember we installed the driver ourselves already). To extract them, execute the runfile installer with --extract option:

chmod +x cuda_version_linux-run
./cuda_version_linux-run --extract=$HOME

5) Execute the second one to install the CUDA Toolkit 10.0:

sudo ./cuda-linux.version.run

6) After the installation finishes, you must configure the runtime library:

sudo bash -c "echo /usr/local/cuda/lib64/ > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf"
sudo ldconfig

7) It is also recommended for Ubuntu users to append string /usr/local/cuda/bin to system file /etc/environment so that nvcc will be included in $PATH. This will take effect after reboot. To do that, you just have to:

sudo vim /etc/environment
or 
sudo nano /etc/environment

8) Then add :/usr/local/cuda/bin (including the ":") at the end of the PATH="/blah:/blah/blah" string (inside the quotes)

9) reboot

troubleshoot:

If some drivers already installed previously, uninstall using the following:

sudo apt-get purge nvidia-*
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge
