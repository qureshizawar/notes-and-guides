Firewall configuration using iptables

The iptables utility is available on most Linux distributions to set firewall rules and policies. These Linux distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x, CentOS 7.x, SLES 12, Ubuntu, and Debian. Before using these commands, check which firewall zones might be enabled by default. Depending upon the zone setup, the INPUT and OUTPUT terms might need to be renamed to match a zone for the desired rule. See the following Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x example for one such case.

Issue the following command to list the current firewall policies.
```
sudo iptables -S
sudo iptables -L
```

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 172.31.1.0/24 --dport 1191 -j ACCEPT
```
Issue the following command to open port 1191 (GPFS) for outbound TCP traffic to internal subnet 172.31.1.0/24.
